Ampoule of False Blood,Neck,"This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood.

A bastion banner emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion whose holy symbol graces the banner. Within the 40-foot radius of its hallow effect, a planted bastion banner secures terrain that would otherwise be unstable, whether due to natural causes (such as a mudslide) or supernatural causes (such as a specific plane's morphic trait). Natural terrain is simply fixed in its current configuration and cannot be altered naturally or magically; a spellcaster attempting to change the terrain affected by a bastion banner (such as with move earth or transmute mud to rock) must make a successful DC 21 caster level check to do so. Unnaturally or magically morphic terrain (such as that on the Abyss) is shaped into a 40-foot sphere with the topmost hemispherical half composed of breathable air and the lower hemispherical half composed of packed earth. This effect only secures basic footing against collapse; it cannot impede moving objects from outside the area (such as rain or an avalanche) or forces that act physically on the soil (such as shovels or tunneling creatures). When planted, a bastion banner also has a specific spell tied to the hallow effect, as well as an additional effect, both tied to the holy symbol it bears. When a bastion banner affects allies, the allies must worship the same deity as the one portrayed on the banner to benefit from the deity-specific spell and effect, and only as long as they are within 40 feet of the banner. Enemies must also be within 40 feet of the banner to be affected.

Crafted from bronze, brass, or countless other semiprecious metals, these miniature bells — no more than an inch tall — hang from delicate chains or short silken cords and ring with a tinny tinkling. Typically affixed over doorframes or to precious objects, when rung frequently these ornaments supposedly ward off gremlins and protect those nearby from ill fortune. And unlike most such folk magic, expertly made gremlin bells actually work. Gremlin bells have two uses. First, they irritate gremlins. Any gremlin that comes within 20 feet of a gremlin bell cannot make use of any of its supernatural abilities and becomes uncomfortable, typically seeking to leave the area (though it is not compelled to do so). Secondly, once per day a gremlin bell can be purposefully rung. All gremlins within 20 feet who can hear the chime must make a DC 16 Will save or be sickened for the next 5 minutes.",No,400 ,200 ,-,2,0,Faint,Abjuration,Craft Wondrous Item,Protection From Evil,-,12,1,PAP 19: Howl of the Carrion King,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/a-b/bell-gremlin,

Cage of Captivity,Slotless,"This miniature cage of golden wire can be used to capture a weakened outsider once per day. The target outsider must be called or otherwise physically present; a cage of captivity has no effect on summoned outsiders. The target also must be unable to take actions continually throughout the entire process, whether cowering, dazed, dying, helpless, stunned, or unconscious. The user can attempt to draw a subdued outsider into the cage of captivity by placing gemstones within and concentrating for 1 minute. These gems must be worth at least 100 gp per Hit Dice of the target. If the target fails a DC 20 Will save—this increases to DC 25 if the user speaks the target's true name—the target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is drawn into the cage, as the minimum containment option of the binding spell. Any creature holding the cage can converse with the trapped outsider. The planar being cannot use any supernatural or spell-like abilities while trapped, but it can still interact with, lie to, and manipulate captors using appropriate skill checks. Anyone holding the cage of captivity may attempt to open it as a standard action. If an outsider is trapped within, doing so requires a DC 22 Will save. If a creature fails this save, they cannot open the cage and are repulsed by it for 24 hours as per the antipathy spell. The user who originally captured the imprisoned outsider gains a +5 morale bonus on this save. Any creature opening a cage of captivity can compel the trapped outsider to perform a service in exchange for its release. The trapped creature is compelled to fulfill this request as geas/quest if the creature opening the cage of captivity knows the creature's true name. If not, this request functions as lesser geas if the trapped outsider has 7 or fewer Hit Dice, or as suggestion if it has more than 7 Hit Dice. These requests ignore any spell resistance of the trapped outsider, but a successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect.

When burned, the candle sheds eerie illumination in a radius of 15 feet, similar to Abaddon’s perpetual eclipse.

The light also acts as a magic circle against evil, but only against daemons.

"Candle, Grave",Slotless,"Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth spirits from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to these spirits for a short period while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body whose spirit the user wishes to contact. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When the candle is lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak. A grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages to its user. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead, save that the dead spirit takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can be subjected to the effects of a grave candle only once—the burning of a grave candle effectively burns out the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's departure from the world (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit, however) and destroys the candle.",No,"5,500 ","2,750 ",-,10,1,Moderate,Necromancy,Craft Wondrous Item,Speak With Dead,-,20,1,PCS: Occult Mysteries,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/candle-grave,

Chime of Opening,Slotless,"A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level. The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open.

"Coffer, Death's Head",Slotless,"Typically engraved with numerous skulls, these small metal coffers allow the safe transport of infectious substances of up to Tiny size. Closing the lid seals in the contents and holds them in stasis, rendering them immune to aging or any damage. In addition, any infectious material—such as the body of a creature that died of disease—is preserved for as long as the coffer is closed. A death’s head coffer can potentially hold several Tiny items, having dimensions of approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 inches. A death’s head coffer can spread infections between items. Any item placed into a coffer with a diseaseridden item (something capable of spreading a disease by contact) becomes infected with the same disease. For 1 week after being removed from the coffer, the newly infected item can spread the same affliction as the disease-ridden item to any creature that touches it. For example, a coin placed into a death’s head coffer with a rat infected with the shakes forces any creature that touches the coin to make a DC 13 Fortitude save or become infected with the shakes as well. After a death’s head coffer is closed and then reopened, its magic dissipates, rendering the box completely mundane.

"Crux, Chelish",Slotless,"A Devil's crux is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest. When closed, a Devil's crux is a wooden and metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12) that measures about 6 inches in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune or image — in order to open the puzzle box, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time a rune is triggered in the correct order in this manner, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever a rune is triggered out of order, the light flashes into fire and inflicts 2 points of fire damage per currently lit rune on the person attempting to open the crux (Reflex DC 15 halves) and causes all lit faces to deactivate (forcing the process of opening it to start anew). Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the combination of runes to randomize to a new combination. You can simulate this puzzle for the PCs by determining the order in which the runes must be activated and then having the players stumble through the combinations, or you can allow a character a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box — each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at which point the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and causes 2 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 halves), plus 2 points for each failure. A Devil's crux can be forced open with damage or a DC 28 Strength check. The crux has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If a crux is forced open in either of these two ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, inflicting 3d6+6 points of fire damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 halves). The fire damage affects any objects held within the crux as well. If forced open, the crux crumbles to ashes and any objects it contains appear on the ground at the site of the fiery burst. Once a particular crux’s combination is known, a character can open it automatically (this takes 3 consecutive full-round actions). Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit upon the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet’s four corners as a move-equivalent action. The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time — objects that would exceed the crux’s capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. A Devil's crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects, but the physical size of each object is irrelevant — the sight of a crux folding up around a long polearm, for example, might make one assume the weapon was crushed and destroyed, but when the crux is next opened, the pole arm is unharmed. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Devil's crux functions as a bag of holding for determining how long a living creature within can survive, or for what happens when the crux is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole.",No,"2,000 ","1,000 ",-,9,5,Moderate,Conjuration,Craft Wondrous Item,Secret Chest,-,19,1,PAP 27: What Lies in Dust,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/c-d/crux-devils,
"Crux, Marionette",Slotless,"Short lengths of twine dangle sharp metal needles from each end of this cross-shaped wooden bar. To use a marionette crux, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out. If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim’s wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain. In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person. The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux’s wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack—passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid.

This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).",No,"40,000 ","20,000 ",-,5,1,Faint,Transmutation,Craft Wondrous Item,Instant Enemy,(Misc) Favored Enemy class feature,20,2,PRG: Ultimate Equipment,http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/e-g/enmity-fetish,

Fate-Reader's Lenses,Slotless,"Fate-reader's lenses consist of two specially crafted harrow decks. The decks sport a stylized image of an eye on the back of each card—one deck's eyes are red, and the deck's eyes are blue. Each card in the red deck is linked to its corresponding card in the blue deck. The owner can peer through the eyes of any card from the red deck to see whatever is in front of the corresponding blue-eyed card, as if using enter image. The owner can peer through any red card at will; drawing a random card and peering through it is a standard action, while going through the deck and selecting a specific card is a full-round action. If the corresponding blue card is still shuffled in with the rest of the blue deck, it is automatically moved to the top of that deck, ready to be drawn by whoever bears it. Once a blue card is drawn, it can be placed on a creature's person with a successful Sleight of Hand check or stuck to any sturdy flat surface, where it remains until moved again by either you or another creature. Only a single pair of cards can have a visual link between them at any time, and placing a red card at the bottom of its deck causes the eye on the matching blue card to close, ending the visual link until the red card is peered through again. While the blue cards can be meted out and separated however the owner desires, the red cards lose their magic if separated from the red-eyed harrow deck for more than 10 minutes.

This burst of ebon flame extinguishes all natural fires and dispels magical fire (dispel check 1d20+5) in the area, including magic items that have fire effects (such as a flametongue sword or a necklace of fireballs), although items dispelled merely cease to function for 1d4 rounds. The ebon flame can cure damage caused by fire— each creature in the burst is healed 5d6 points of damage caused by fire effects. A creature with the fire subtype inside the area of the burst takes 5d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round — a successful DC 15 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.

In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat.

Haunt Siphon,Slotless,"These glass vials are held within stylized cold-iron casings etched with strange runes, necromantic designs, or other eldritch markings.

To capture a haunt’s energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action)—this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt’s area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt’s hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green—if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy powerful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a –5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit.

Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust.

The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within a Spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within a Spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar’s holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell.

Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder of a meduseion can cause the eyes of the head to shoot forth a petrifying ray as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 100 feet.

Once per day on command, the cube disintegrates into a cloud of countless Fine flying constructs that resemble mechanical fireflies. These fireflies cluster and flutter about in a 60-foot-radius spread around the user, homing in on Tiny or larger masses of metal and illuminating them as though the objects emitted candlelight. The fireflies continue to highlight metal objects for 5 minutes before swarming back into cube-form in the user's hand. Creatures in the area wearing metal armor are illuminated as if by faerie fire. Creatures in the area wielding metal weapons are dazzled as long as they are within range of the mechanical fireflies and continue to wield the weapons.

When the locker is unsealed and opened, the migrus—a desiccated hairless cat with a humanoid face—is found within. After a few moments the migrus animates and begins to clean itself, and its face begins to take the appearance of the creature who opened the migrus locker. The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master. The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body. The migrus has attributes of a cat familiar except it has the construct type. The migrus always does its best to return to its master and cannot be permanently destroyed by normal means.

Mirror of Guarding Reflections,Slotless,"Reflections visible in this palm-sized hand mirror always seem ghostly and insubstantial. When a creature holding the mirror is targeted by an attack, he can spend an immediate action to summon his reflection from the glass to interpose itself between him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result.

Mirror of Life Trapping,Slotless,"This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack). When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.

The controller first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying spell.

This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic).

Mummified Guardian,Slotless,"This mummified house cat—dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen wrappings— appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpse. In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified guardian to 3,000 gp). If the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.

Music Box Trap,Slotless,"A silhouette of a miniature dancer graces the center of this simple music box. When opened, the music box plays a delicate tune only a few notes long. Although worth 200 gp as a work of art, the music box's true value is as a spell repository. A spellcaster can store a single targeted mind-affecting spell of up to 4th level into a closed music box trap that is not currently storing a spell. Thereafter, when the music box trap is opened and allowed to play for 1 round, the stored spell targets the creature that opened the box. If this would result in the spell being cast at an inappropriate target, or if the creature moves farther than the spell's range away from the music box during the 1-round delay, the spell is discharged with no effect. The original spellcaster remains the caster of the stored spell; for example, a charm person spell successfully delivered onto a target from a music box trap makes the creature well disposed to the spellcaster, even if the spellcaster is long gone. There is no obvious indicator that the music box trap delivers a stored spell onto the creature opening the box, but while the box is open, those who succeed at a DC 25 Perception check notice that the miniature dancer is keeping her gaze fixed upon the pending target.

Paradox Box,Slotless,"A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box—it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box—most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words.

When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being.

The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.

Preyfinder,Slotless,"These sturdy brass compasses are often painted blood red and etched with images of wolves, lions, crocodiles, or sharks stalking their prey. Though preyfinders function as standard compasses, making them useful tools for navigation, they also have the power to magically identify and track down creatures. To use a preyfinder, its bearer must (as a standard action) take a drop of blood from a creature, smear it onto the compass's glass faceplate, and then touch the compass to his head. The blood must be no more than 1 week old, and can come from a living or dead creature, though a living or undead target can attempt a DC 18 Will save to resist the preyfinder's tracking ability. If the Will save is successful, the preyfinder can't identify or locate the creature, and none of the preyfinder's magical powers function for 24 hours. If the creature fails the Will save, the preyfinder telepathically provides its bearer with an image of the creature to which the drop of blood belonged and marks the creature as the preyfinder's quarry. After a creature is marked as the preyfinder's quarry, the bearer can spend a standard action to magically divine the creature's current location.

These devices are created by spellcasters who wish to control their own retrievers, since the secret of creating those monsters is beyond mortal capacity to understand. A retriever drone can be used to usurp control of a retriever that is within 30 feet. To take control of a retriever, the user of a retriever drone must have line of sight to the target and concentrate on it while holding the retriever drone in both hands. The target retriever can resist the attempt to take control by succeeding at a DC 16 Will save. If the retriever is currently on a mission to retrieve a target, it gains a +8 bonus on this save. If the retriever's saving throw is successful, the drone thrashes and scurries, making a single +15 bite attack (1d6+4 damage) against its carrier before becoming inert for 24 hours. If the retriever fails to resist, it falls under the control of the person who carried the drone—this control is permanent as long as the retriever drone exists and the person who activated the drone is chaotic evil. If the controller isn't chaotic evil, control granted lasts for only 24 hours. If the retriever controlled by a drone is destroyed, the drone itself crumbles to dust. As a full-round action while touching an active retriever drone, the user can look through the eyes of a controlled retriever and direct its actions.

"Robe, Summoner's",Body,"A summoner's robe is a finely crafted garment of silk the same color as the endless sky of the Astral Plane. Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends. As long as the robe has a defensive aura, its wearer gains some of the absorbed creature's defenses and powers. These abilities are determined as if the wearer were using a transmutation (polymorph) spell to assume the absorbed creature's form. Unlike a normal polymorph effect, it does not grant her the appearance of the creature (or any bonus to Disguise), any movement type, natural attacks (or proficiency with them), or size change. The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed.

Solidsmoke Pipeweed,Slotless,"When smoked in any pipe, this pinch of magical tobacco produces a languid, milky-white smoke that the smoker can transform into useful objects.

The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.

Spirit Planchette (Brass),Slotless,"A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist—brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this “board” can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface—it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette’s surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board—at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the séance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below.  The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” or “maybe,” or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day—the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a –2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used.

Spirit Planchette (Cold Iron),Slotless,"A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist—brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this “board” can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface—it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette’s surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board—at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the séance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below.  The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with “yes,” “no,” or “maybe,” or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day—the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits.

If the jar shatters in a square that isn't currently occupied by an existing swarm, it creates a locust swarm that follows the thrower's mental commands; these commands may be issued as a free action. If the jar shatters in a square occupied by a swarm, the swarm must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become controlled by the thrower. Issuing mental commands to a swarm (whether it's a freshly created locust swarm or a controlled swarm) is a move action, but once the swarm has been issued orders, it continues to follow those orders until it's destroyed or the magic of the swarmlord's jar ends. A locust swarm created by this item lasts for 1 minute if not destroyed earlier. Likewise, control granted by the jar lasts for 1 minute.

Third Eye,Slotless,"The practice of third eye magic has a long-standing tradition among a Vudran mystical organization known as the Daughters of the Blinding Night. A practitioner of this mysterious sect visited Bahor and Vimanda some years ago to grant them this magic in return for a wealth of magic and secrets the Arkonas stole from the Acadamae. As part of the process of gaining a third eye, the creator grafts an actual eye into the palm of the recipient’s hand. Generally human eyes are used, but any eye harvested from a creature the same size as the recipient will do. Once an eye is grafted into a palm, it is undetectable while closed and doesn’t hinder the user’s manual dexterity in the slightest. When in use, the eye opens. The owner of a third eye can use it to see through the donor creature’s remaining eye. The third eye can also be attuned to specially prepared bloodstones, allowing the user to observe things in that stone’s vicinity as if it were an eye as well. Preparing a bloodstone in this manner requires it to soak in a potion of clairvoyance/clairaudience for a week, at the end of which the owner drinks the potion and spits the bloodstone into the hand bearing the third eye. These bloodstones are often incorporated into magic items like phylacteries, rings, or amulets, allowing the user to gift such items to other creatures and thus gain a new viewpoint. This remote viewing ability functions at any range while on the same plane. It also allows the user to cast clairaudience/clairvoyance up to three times per day. As long as the third eye is open in a hand that isn’t holding an object, the creature gains all-round vision, granting a +4 bonus on Perception checks and making it impossible to flank them. Rakshasas, whose fingers bend backwards, can use the powers of their third eyes while holding an object since the eye effectively looks out of the “back” of their hand.

Traveler's Translator,Slotless,"This single earring consists of a prismatic crystal set into a platinum bezel. A traveler's translator provides its owner a basic and limited ability to communicate with intelligent creatures that speak unfamiliar languages.

When its owner speaks the command word, the traveler's translator begins listening to all spoken conversations and speech within 30 feet. After 1 minute of exposure to a language other than its base language, the translator learns the new language. Thereafter, the item automatically translates speech of the newly learned language into the translator's base language, telepathically imparting the translated words to its owner. A traveler's translator can store only one learned language at a time and can learn only one language per day—speaking the command word again after at least 24 hours causes the translator to erase the previously learned language (but not its base language) to make room for a new language. As a standard action, the owner of the stone can designate a single creature within 30 feet. When the owner speaks aloud to that creature in the translator's base language, the traveler's translator telepathically transmits the owner's meaning to the target, using the learned language.

Voidstick,?,"In remote parts of the world, it is not always practical for the faithful to visit holy places with any regularity. In particular, the weak, the sick, and the dying may be in no position to trek across plains or risk dangerous water crossings to see their spiritual leaders. In response to this, the godstick was born—a crafted rod that serves as a portable shrine, carried by shamans and witchdoctors and pushed into the ground to focus devotion at any location. Ingenuity is not just the way of the benign, however, and just as often it is the way of evil. Before long, shamans who worshiped more hateful deities corrupted this notion; they created the voidsticks and drove them into bodies, living or dead, charging those bodies with the power of the endless void and creating rattling, hungry abominations. Each voidstick is 6 to 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch. Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20-foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. Voidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie.

After wielding this wayfinder for 24 hours, its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which the wayfinder will cast the highest-level spell stored in the gem with the wearer as the spell's target, as though it were using the contingency spell. For example, the wielder of a contingent wayfinder could place a cure moderate wounds spell in the wayfinder's gem, then specify that if she ever falls unconscious because of lethal damage, the spell must be cast on her. Once used in such a manner, the wayfinder requires 1 month to recharge its contingency effect, though a new spell can be cast into the enclosed gem at any time during this period.

If the wielder of a noisemaker wayfinder is affected by a magical sleep effect (such as that caused by a sleep spell) and the alarm is triggered, the constant buzzing and vibration of the wayfinder allows the wielder to attempt a saving throw each round at the end of her turn to end the sleep effect and gives her a +2 circumstance bonus on such saves.
